                    For me, every new Blender Release is very exiting. In Blender 2.8, it was the real-time rendering engine EVEE,
                    and for Blender 3.0, there is so much, that I do not know where to start. As an owner of an AMD Radeon RTX5700, 
                    I am curious how the for Q2/2022 announced AMD graphics support of Blender running under Linux will boost my render performance. </br>
                    Until the official release of this feature, there is plenty of things to discover; a Blender update usually comes with so many changes in
                    the functionality and GUI, that a "familiarization project" is a great idea. I wanted to create a scene with a Particle System;
                    with these I had some (perfomance) issues in the past. For the composition, I was thinking about a lighthouse situated on top of a cliff.
                    That was something I had never done and the cone shape should put my hard surface modeling capabilities to the test.</br>
                    After getting the proportions right and a pleasant compostion established, I added more details like plants, a bench etc. to the scene. 
                    The grass is a simple Particle System of Type "Hair". It took some time until I could produce a satisfying density and color variation.
                    In the end, I used two Particle Systems with different settings and colors.  </br>
                    Throughout the whole process, I was not satisfied with the lighting. I was after a more cartoonish look than photorealism. My first attempt 
                    was to crank up the intensity of my main scene light. This resulted in issues with the colors and shadows. Afterwards, I tried an HDRI. The 
                    illumination was better, but the ultra realistic sky of the HDRI of choice did not fit to the cartoonish style in the foreground. By accident
                    I stumbled across a new-to-me feature in Blender: Dynamic Skyboxes. The setup was very simple; just setting the sky and horizon color as well
                    as the sun properties. After some test renders and tweaking the oversaturated colors (due to my previous brute force attempts) I got a nice, partially
                    cloudy sky. Like expected, the render time increased drastically when switching from normal lighting to the skybox. The final render at
                    1920p took on my Threadripper 16 Thread CPU over two minutes (2:03). After the Blender update, I noticed that the out-of-the-box settings
                    increased the render times in comparison to Blender 2.9. However, the simple sky generation did in my opinion more than justify it.</br>
                    For those who are interested in my artistic decisions, I created a pdf-presentation 
                    outlining the main progress points. It can be downloaded from <a href="../Blender/particleSystems_skybox/lighthouse_creation-process_documentation_2022-01-19.pdf">here</a> or be viewed in the embedded pdf-viewer below.

                    Usually, whilst working on scientific publications, there is no graphics designer available. Additionally, the expensive professional
                    graphics tools are normally not included in the software catalogs of universities or research institutions. 
                    For 2D (vector based) graphics, Inkscape, GIMP and Krita are a great OpenSource solutions. For 3D, there are less viable options 
                    (besides perhaps for molecular structure visualization). Blender is great not only because it is for free, but also has a huge community
                    which can help when a scientist with little modeling experience should experience any problems.
