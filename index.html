            <p>
                This webpage is a collection of projects I have been working on from 2013 until today. </br>
                scope of the projects covers a broad range, including topics such as art, coding, science and typesetting. </br>
                Most files are available in the associated github-repository: 
                <a href="https://github.com/d-sacre/portfolio">https://github.com/d-sacre/portfolio</a>. </br>
                If files are stored on an external server (e. g. a server of a publisher), 
                I will provide the link to the original source.

                  <p>
                    My interest in art stems from my time as a student and was originally acquired out of necessity: In every scientific publication some graphics need to be custom-created, 
                    but the fewest scientists have professional graphics design training. In order to be able to publish not only scientifically sound, but also visually appealing and easy-to-read papers,
                    learning some basic skills in photography, color theory, format conversion, post-processing and 3D modeling became necessary.
                    From there, my relationship with art grew from professional necessity to personal passion. I especially love the concept of procedural art, since it combines the seemingly contradictory scientific rationality
                    with the artistic ease in a very beautiful way.

                  <h3><b>CODING</b></h3>
                  <h5><span class="w3-opacity">Last Update: February 3, 2022</span></h5>

                  <p>
                    Similar to my interest in art, I originally started coding for professional reasons: In research, one often times needs to measure
                    quantities without having the option to use commercially available instruments. However, custom-built or modified equipment always requires coding-skills in order to get it up and running. </br>
                    Once the hardware is set up and working, one needs to effectively analyze and sometimes deal with huge amounts of data. This is often hard or even next to impossible with the GUI-programs which are available on the market. </br>
                    Another benefit of being proficient in at least one programming language: If computer simulations are required, one has a basic understanding of the underlying programming concepts, which makes the whole simulation design phase a lot easier, no matter which language or tool is used.

                <h3><b>TYPESETTING</b></h3>
                <h5><span class="w3-opacity">Last Update: June 21, 2022</span></h5>
              </div>

              <div class="w3-container">
                <p>
                  My first contact with professional, scientific typesetting was 2013. 
                  During my studies, I had to write many protocols and two theses. 
                  Their requirements regarding scientific notation made LaTeX basically a necessity. </br>
                  After tinkering a bit on my own, I attended two university courses and received proper training 
                  in (mostly) LaTeX2ε. This led to an ongoing obsession with LaTeX, especially creating images with TikZ 
                  and visualizing data with pgfplotstable. 
                  Over the years, I was involved in typesetting four scientific papers and assisted countless times if 
                  colleagues or friends had LaTeX problems. Recently, I began to explore LuaLaTeX and LaTeX3
                  with its seemingly endless realm of possibilities. As a result of the exploration, I started to create my first homemade 
                  packages and classes.
